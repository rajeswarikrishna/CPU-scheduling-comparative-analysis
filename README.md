**Overview**

This project is a Python-based simulator designed to implement and analyze multiple CPU scheduling algorithms. It enables users to compare the performance of various algorithms under identical workload conditions. The simulator computes key performance metrics such as CPU utilization, throughput, average waiting time, and average turnaround time.

**Implemented Algorithms**

The simulator includes the following CPU scheduling algorithms:

1. Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)

2. Multilevel Queue (MLQ) Scheduling

3. Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling

4. Fair Share Scheduling

**Objectives**

-> To simulate and visualize the behavior of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms.

-> To analyze and compare their efficiency using quantitative metrics.

-> To understand trade-offs between scheduling policies.

**Performance Metrics**

The following metrics are calculated for each algorithm:

1. CPU Utilization

2. Throughput

3. Average Waiting Time

4. Average Turnaround Time

**Features**

-> User-friendly interface for input and result visualization.

-> Graphical comparison of performance metrics across algorithms.

-> Modular and extensible design to easily add new scheduling algorithms.

-> Code written in Python with clear structure and comments for academic use.
